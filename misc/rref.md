My Math 18 Professor Zelmanov has a characteristic way of row reducing matrices
to echelon form. I would like to thus make a row reducer that mimics his
entertaining personality while showing the steps.

When I see a matrix, this is what I will do:

1. If there's a row that starts with 1, especially if the top row starts with a
   0, I will swap the row with the first row.

2. If the first row's first number isn't 1, I will multiply the row to make it
   one. This technically isn't necessary, but humans work better like this.

3. For the rest of the rows, I will multiply the first row by the respective
   row's first number but opposite (so 2 -> -2), then add that to the respective
   row.

4. The first column should be all good for reduced row echelon form.

5. The second row's leading entry should be in the second column.

   - If not, then there might be some other row below it with a non-zero entry
     in the second column.
   - There might be a free variable in the second column. If so, carry on to the
     third column.
   - If not, then there's a row with a leading entry. Of course, prefer the row
     that starts with 1. Swap it with the second row.

6. Kill the other numbers in the column.

7. Repeat for the rest of the columns.

8. Either I have reached the last row or column. If I have only reached the last
   row, the rest of the columns are free variables. We're done. If I reached the
   last column, then presumably I'll have to kill the other variables in the
   column before finishing.

9. Also, if there is a zero row, it can be dropped.

So I suppose here is a generalized form of the algorithm.

1. For each column:

   1. Let _r_ be the row under the rightmost leading entry excavated so far. If
      this is the first iteration, that'll be the first row. If there is no such row, we're done!

   2. Find a more suitable row for _r_ in _r_ and all the rows below _r_
      according to these conditions:

      1. The entry in the column may not be zero.
      2. If the entry in the column is 1, then it is the most suitable.
      3. Otherwise, take any non-zero entry. Note: Zelmenov prefered 9 over 27,
         but I am not sure if I should try to mimic that here.
      4. If all the available entries are zero, continue to the next column.

   3. Swap that row with the current row in _r_. This might be a no-op if the
      current row is already suitable.

   4. Kill the entries that are easier to kill in the other rows. This can all
      be done in a single step. For each of the other rows _i_, let _c_ be equal
      to -_a_\__i_ / _a_\__r_, where _a_\__i_ is the entry in row _i_ and
      _a_\__r_ is the entry in row _r_ in the column. If _c_ is an integer,
      multiply row _r_ by _c_ and add it to row _i_.

      - As a separate step, forget about any new zero rows.

   5. If the leading entry in _r_ is not 1, divide row _r_ by the leading entry.

   6. Repeat step 4, but without the integer constraint. This should thus kill
      all the other entries in the column.
